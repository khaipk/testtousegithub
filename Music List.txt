Take me to your heart, take me to your soul, give me your hands and hold me, show me what the love is, be my guiding star.
Fly to the sky, then cry on my shoulder
Until you
Like you like you do
Crush
Sugar
Love you more than I can say
Wherever you are, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you.
